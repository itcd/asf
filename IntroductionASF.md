# Introduction #

ASF stands for A Simple Framework for presenting visual and auditory stimuli in behavioral experiments. It is based on the Psychophysics Toolbox for Matlab www.psychtoolbox.org, which needs to be installed for ASF to run. The idea is to write a program that reduces the experimenterâ€™s task of programming behavioral experiments to generating tables of stimulus- and trial descriptions while accurate timing of stimuli, collecting responses from different devices such as voice-keys, button boxes or a computer mouse, generating triggers for EEG/MEG equipment and synchronization with MR-scanners and response-logging is dealt with in the background.
