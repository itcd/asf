The asf toolbox is an open source package for conducting experiments in the field of Cognitive Neuroscience using behavioral, physiological and neuroimaging techniques.
It has been developed at the [Center for Mind/Brain Sciences](http://http://www.unitn.it/en/cimec) at the [University of Trento](http://www.unitn.it), Italy, where different researchers are using asf for psychophysics, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), Magnetoencephalography (MEG), and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) to study perception, attention, action, and decision making.

ASF stands for A Simple Framework
  * It is based on the Psychophysics Toolbox for Matlab
  * It is an attempt to take care of those tasks that are inherent in every computer     controlled experiment: stimulus presentation and response collection
  * Its emphasis is on accurate timing, easy interfacing with different hardware and     clear documented interface of what goes in and what comes out
